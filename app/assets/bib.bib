  abstract={We present measurements and theoretical modeling of the ionic conductance G of solid-state nanopores with 5–100 nm diameters, with and without DNA inserted into the pore. First, we show that it is essential to include access resistance to describe the conductance, in particular for larger pore diameters. We then present an exact solution for G of an hourglass-shaped pore, which agrees very well with our measurements without any adjustable parameters, and which is an improvement over the cylindrical approximation. Subsequently we discuss the conductance blockade Δ G due to the insertion of a DNA molecule into the pore, which we study experimentally as a function of pore diameter. We find that Δ G decreases with pore diameter, contrary to the predictions of earlier models that forecasted a constant Δ G . We compare three models for Δ G , all of which provide good agreement with our experimental data.}

  abstract ={It has recently been recognized that solid-state nanopores in single-atomic-layer graphene membranes can be used to electronically detect and characterize single long charged polymer molecules. We have now fabricated nanopores in single-layer graphene that are closely matched to the diameter of a double-stranded DNA molecule. Ionic current signals during electrophoretically driven translocation of DNA through these nanopores were experimentally explored and theoretically modeled. Our experiments show that these nanopores have unusually high sensitivity (0.65 nA/Å) to extremely small changes in the translocating molecule’s outer diameter. Such atomically short graphene nanopores can also resolve nanoscale-spaced molecular structures along the length of a polymer, but do so with greatest sensitivity only when the pore and molecule diameters are closely matched. Modeling confirms that our most closely matched pores have an inherent resolution of ≤0.6 nm along the length of the molecule.},
