  abstract={We present measurements and theoretical modeling of the ionic conductance G of solid-state nanopores with 5–100 nm diameters, with and without DNA inserted into the pore. First, we show that it is essential to include access resistance to describe the conductance, in particular for larger pore diameters. We then present an exact solution for G of an hourglass-shaped pore, which agrees very well with our measurements without any adjustable parameters, and which is an improvement over the cylindrical approximation. Subsequently we discuss the conductance blockade Δ G due to the insertion of a DNA molecule into the pore, which we study experimentally as a function of pore diameter. We find that Δ G decreases with pore diameter, contrary to the predictions of earlier models that forecasted a constant Δ G . We compare three models for Δ G , all of which provide good agreement with our experimental data.}
